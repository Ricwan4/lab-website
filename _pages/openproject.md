## OpenProject

We are excited to introduce a new initiative at our lab, the **OpenProject**. This initiative aims to foster collaboration both within and outside our lab. We have a plethora of ideas and projects that we are eager to explore, and we invite interested researchers to join us in this endeavor. Please contact us (Prof. Haiyan Wu, <haiyanwu@um.edu.mo>) if you are interested in collaborating on any of the projects listed below or if you have any questions.

### Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire (IMQ)

The IMQ project is based on the Interactive Mentalizing Questionnaire, a tool developed to study mentalizing during social interaction. The IMQ is an open resource and can be used without asking for permission. The questionnaire is designed to measure three abilities:

- IMQ_SO: The ability to infer the mental states and thoughts of others
- IMQ_SS: The ability to look inward to self-monitor and assess thought processes
- IMQ_OS: The ability to make inferences about how much insight one thinks other agents have into one's own thoughts and intentions

The IMQ project is open for collaboration and we encourage researchers interested in mentalization and social cognition to use this tool in their studies. More details about the project can be found on the [IMQ GitHub repository](https://github.com/andlab-um/IMQ){:target="_blank"} and the corresponding paper [Mentalizing during social interaction: the development and validation of the interactive mentalizing questionnaire](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.791835){:target="_blank"}.

### Mouse-Tracking Electroencephalography (EEG) Dataset

The Mouse-Tracking EEG Dataset project provides a dataset combining high-density Electroencephalography (HD-EEG, 128 channels) and mouse-tracking. This dataset is intended as a resource for investigating dynamic decision processing of semantic and food preference choices in the brain. 

The project includes scripts for data preprocessing, preliminary analysis, and visualization. We encourage researchers interested in EEG data and decision-making processes to use this dataset in their studies. More details about the project can be found on the [MT-EEG-dataset GitHub repository](https://github.com/andlab-um/MT-EEG-dataset){:target="_blank"} and the corresponding paper [A resource for assessing dynamic binary choices in the adult brain using EEG and mouse-tracking](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01538-5){:target="_blank"}.

We believe that these projects offer exciting opportunities for collaboration and advancement in the field of cognitive neuroscience. We look forward to working with interested researchers and contributing to the open science movement.
